Professional brand statement
I am a known project manager with a record of completing projects on time. I am the go-to man when it comes to hard- to--complete tasks and projects. I am the yes man when everyone else says No. Energetic, passionate and outgoing with a laugh that is contagious, I currently have a project for a small business to build its new web presence. I have a good name in the IT field that I have built over a ten-year career.

            I am looking forward to moving out of this state. I grew up here in Tucson AZ, I have spengt most of my adult life here in AZ except for the ten years I spent over seas. I am tired of the hot and dry. I would kill someone to see some rain and grass!
